st.markdown("""
- **Early and Late Tenure Vulnerability**: Churn peaks during early customer relationships and again at the 9-year mark.  
- **Gender Disparity (insignificant)**: Females show higher churn (1 in 5) compared to males (1 in 8).  
- **Geographic Variation**: Germany has significantly higher churn rates proportionally compared to France and Spain.  
- **Credit Card Correlation**: Customers with credit cards are more likely to exit the bank.  
- **Multi-Service Risk**: Customers using 3 or more services (loan, savings account, credit card) have higher exit rates.  
- **Account Balance Factor**: Higher account balance correlates with increased likelihood of churning.
